# Basemate UI Core

## What is basemate?

basemate is a "Rails Engine", turning the MVC-Framework "Ruby on Rails" into a
Fullstack Web-Development Framework. With basemate you are able to write dynamic
Web-Apps in pure Ruby. Javascript/HTML/CSS is only used for adding special, custom
UI-Behaviour.

basemate is designed to write maintainable, dynamic Web-UIs on top of Rails with
minimum effort. In order to increase development speed, basemate's architecture
moves back- and frontend development closer together. In other words: basemate
melts Rails and Vue.js down to one holistic Web App Development Framework.

basemate progressively replaces the classic Rails-View-Layer. You are able to use
it alongside your classic views and incrementally turn your Rails-App into a
dynamic, more maintainable Web-App.


## Current State

wait to start :)
