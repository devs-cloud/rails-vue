# Scaffolding Matestack concepts using generators

This is a WIP feature. Reach out to us with feedback or if things don't behave the way you'd expect them to do!

## General usage

Create matestack apps, pages and components (and some corresponding parts, like routes and controllers)
automatically from the command line!

Each generator takes mandatory arguments and optional flags. Check their detailed description to see default parameters and the full list of options.

Tests can be found [here](../../spec/lib/generators).

**Note:** We recommend commiting or stashing your current changes so you see created/modified files within your application!

## Matestack App Generator

To see all options, run
```bash
rails generate matestack_app -h
```

## Matestack Page Generator

To see all options, run
```bash
rails generate matestack_page -h
```

More tbd

**Note:** We are huge fans of Test Driven Development, therefore the matestack_page generator per default creates failing tests when invoked!

## Matestack Component Generator

To see all options, run
```bash
rails generate matestack_component -h
```
