# Create Matestack concepts using generators

Those are extensions of the `Rails::Generators` and follow the same system as the classic Rails scaffolders. Reach out to us with feedback or if things don't behave the way you'd expect them to do!

## General usage

Create matestack apps, pages and components (and some corresponding parts, like routes and controllers) automatically from the command line!

Each generator takes mandatory arguments and optional flags. Check their detailed description to see default parameters and the full list of options.

Tests can be found [here](/spec/lib/generators).

**Note:** We recommend commiting or stashing your current changes so you see created/modified files within your application!

Matestack App Generator is documented [here](./matestack_app_generator.md).

Matestack Page Generator is documented [here](./matestack_page_generator.md).

Matestack Component Generator is documented [here](./matestack_component_generator.md).
